  data: "At this point I don\u2019t see any denying this place is cursed. It started
    when Hanse and Friedrich suggested using explosives to find the center of the
    temple where our goal lay. I was against it from the start, but Doyle would not
    be persuaded. The very ground began to swallow us up. After that things only proceeded
    to grow only more dire.\r\n\r\nOne by one our numbers have been reduced. Only
    the captain and I remain. With each loss he seems to have grown more obsessed.
    I fear what will become of us, and that I may never return home to see my precious
    Jenny.\r\n\r\nThe captain has gone ahead. I may soon be the only survivor. It
    is as if someone, or rather some... thing has been stalking us. Doom lies at every
    corner. If you are reading this, turn back before it is too late."

  data: "So today we found it! I think the others were starting to believe my theories
    were the mad ramblings of an old man who had read too many books. The only one
    who never waivered was captain Doyle. The others would\u2019ve given up before
    we ever made it here, but his confidence in the mission is a welcome reassurance.
    Good thing they answer to him.\r\n\r\nJonesey and I shared a bottle of champagne
    with the captain. If the legends are true, we made history today; so I think a
    little celebration is in order. There seems to be a renewed lifting of the morale
    in the others. Even our guide, the woman we hired from Damascus, seems to be relieved.
    I even heard her laughing.\r\n\r\nThe city, the temple, it\u2019s all here just
    like the ancient texts described it. It\u2019s getting late though and we need
    to set up a camp before nightfall. No doubt, tomorrow will bring all sorts of
    discoveries. I\u2019m not sure how I will sleep knowing what sort of excitement
    awaits us at dawn!"
